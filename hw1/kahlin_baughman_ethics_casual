2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.

	Within a person's abilities, professionals should explain and nurture understanding of coputer systems within the public. When talking to the public, the explanations should be clear and concise. The explanations should also invite questions from the public to further understanding. Information to disclose could be things like the impacts certain systms have, what they can and can not do, possible security problems, and possible opportunities they afford. A professional must also respectfully remedy any misunderstandings or myths about computing.

Example:
	A virtual wallet. When telling people how it works, the professional should disclose any vulnerabilities, correct any misinformation about the product, and promise things the wallet can not do. They can explain how it would benefit the user, or future possibilities that the wallet may have.
